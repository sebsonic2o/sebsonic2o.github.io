    <article>
      <p>
        Working with someone else is not always a smooth experience. When pairing, conflicts can arise. For me, it did occur when my pair would just keep blurting "NO!" to anything I would say. I would then wait for him to explain his "NO!". And, after what seemed an eternity, he would proceed talking about something that was unrelated to what I just said. So this situation was extremely unsettling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt like I was absolutely not valued as a person. And my opinion did not matter. To caricature, I could have said "My name is Sebastien" and, still, I should have been prepared for a big no-no. I avoided the conflict, and tried to keep my cool. Unfortunately, the pattern kept repeating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next time, I will make sure to address the conflict head on, verbalizing my feeling so that we can restore a win-win relationship.

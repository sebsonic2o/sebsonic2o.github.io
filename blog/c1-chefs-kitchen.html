  <h1>Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>
  <h2>Or thinking about the Dev Bootcamp experience...</h2>

        Life changing experiences are not easy. I had a few. They shake you to your core, peeling away layers upon layers of coping mechanisms, and mental constructs to feel in a nice cozy place. So why would one want to seek such an experience? For me, it has been sensing that I had been limiting myself over the years. I wish for my world to be as big as possible, embracing all, loving to give and receive. I believe it's worth jumping off a cliff!

        This has drawn me to Dev Bootcamp. Sure, I do want to code again and I absolutely love making things work. But, as per the analogy from Shereef's fireside chat (https://vimeo.com/85001014), do I want to continue to be at the table? Or be in the kitchen? Well, you know what? I am tired to be a consumer, and I'd really like to be a chef. For instance, am I writing this to cross it from an assignment checklist? Heck no! I want this to be meaningful for me and others. Am I good at it? Heck no! Am I going to try and be better at it? Heck yes! I wish for my Dev Bootcamp experience to be just this. So far, it fits. Am I nervous? Heck yes! I've been taught to be a consumer for so long. After barely a week, I am being challenged to be more participative, and willing to share and connect. I feel vulnerable and slow. Am I excited? Heck yes! I see a glimpse of a world full of inspiration. And it starts with a community of beautiful people. We are in this together!

        Am I willing to let go and give my whole self? I sure hope so. Please peel away, Dev Bootcamp! Who knows? I might just grow!

      <p>
        Joining Dev Bootcamp is not only a professional decision, but also a personal one. There is a wonderful framework that promotes giving, receiving, and integrating feedback. It all starts with pairing. Pairing is about trying to solve problems that can be challenging, with one of your peers. This can be intense, and it is important to give your whole self. At first, nervosity was all too present before pairing. After a few weeks, I am already more relaxed. However, I am still feeling drained after pairing...
      </p>
      <p>
        And receiving feedback from my pair does help, because it is not intended to be good nor bad. It is actionable, specific, and kind. Specific is self-explanatory. Actionable demands that the feedback can be controlled by the recipient. Kind is about describing an impact on self, not projecting nor being nice. Being keen on criticizing myself, I was open to receiving constructive feedback. And some of it may be connecting to my need of being in control, when impatience can arise. I want to be a better pair so I will relinquish some control, and still be engaged. First order of business is to stop and listen even when I think I know better...
      </p>
      <p>
        And not being the best listener leads me to mistrust my seeing. Consequently, giving feedback is the most difficult for me. For instance, I still feel that I point out details that are not the most important to my pair. However, this is where meta-feedback comes handy, by allowing others to rate the feedback I give.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is all about having the desire to be better with others. If you don't, you won't! So far, it feels right to me. And the fun has just begun... together!

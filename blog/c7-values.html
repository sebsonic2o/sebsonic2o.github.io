      <p>
        I briefly talked about <a href="./c6-stereotype-threat.html">stereotype threat</a> before. And I equated it to a self-fulfilling prophecy stemming from one's fear of a negative stereotype. How can one overcome such a fear? Sure, an all-inclusive environment would help. But it is also about asserting who you are rather than what you are. It starts with affirming your values, and taking refuge in them. For yourself, first and foremost. Not to judge others. I myself have three values that I try to live by.
      </p>
      <p>
        COMPETENCE. I want my speech and actions to be adequate at all times. Without adequacy, one would never best apply his wholesome qualities. It does require ever expanding skills, knowledge, and capacities. Basically, I need to be less ignorant. It drives confidence, control, coolness under fire, decisiveness, and quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        COMMITMENT. It is not attachment. I just like to dedicate myself to what I do, and whom I love. It relates to accomplishment, achievement, freedom, integrity, loyalty, merit, persistence, responsibility, stability, and will-power.
      </p>
      <p>
        COMPASSION. It is the most important value for me. This value is not about being nice. It is putting myself in someone's else shoes, feeling suffering, and having the desire to relieve and never add suffering. It is the force behind affection, close relationships, embracing all, fairness, friendships, helping others, honesty, inner harmony, inspiration, justice, mentorship, openness, volunteering, recognition, and romance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I believe in causality. So I try to create my own self-fulfilling prophecy by following those three guiding principles. No matter how hard the wind blows from one direction or another, I can still steer the boat. Find your mantra, and remember that...

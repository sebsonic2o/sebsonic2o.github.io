      <p>
        When programming, we try to solve problems performing step-by-step operations. And a self-contained set of operations is an algorithm. However, there can be various algorithms to solve a same problem. For instance, we will look into three different ways to put elements of a list in a certain order, i.e., to sort a list. I will describe, implement (in Ruby), and demonstrate each algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.
      </p>
      <p>
        BUBBLE SORT is a simple sorting algorithm. The algorithm iterates through the array. It compares each pair of adjacent numbers, and swap them if the first value is greater than the second value. Each iteration pass will "bubble" the greater number towards the end of the array. We keep repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass, i.e., sorted.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-ruby">
def bubble_sort(array)

  if array.length > 1

    sorted = false

    # loop until array is sorted
    while !sorted

      sorted = true

      # iterate through array
      for index in (0..array.length-2)

        # compare if first value greater than second value
        if array[index] > array[index+1]

          # set sorted to false if swap occurs
          sorted = false

          # swap values
          number_to_swap = array[index]
          array[index] = array[index+1]
          array[index+1] = number_to_swap
        end
      end
    end
  end

  return array
end
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The bubble sort algorithm performs decently well on small sets, but performance degrades as sets get larger. The downside of the bubble sort is that small numbers towards the end of the array will slow down the sort as the algorithm has to move them one-by-one all the way to the front of the array. Please find below some sample performance tests run with bubble sort.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-ruby">
time_start = Time.now
bubble_sort([2, 8, 9, 0, 6, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1])
time_bubble = Time.now
puts "*** Bubble sort of small array in &num;{time_bubble - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Bubble sort of small array in 1.9e-05 seconds ***

time_start = Time.now
bubble_sort(array_with_1000_numbers)
time_bubble = Time.now
puts "*** Bubble sort of large array in #{time_bubble - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Bubble sort of large array in 0.105054 seconds ***
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        MERGE SORT breaks down an array until it can reconstruct the set by merging sorted sub-sets. The algorithm recursively breaks down the array into smaller sub-sets until each number is its own array, i.e., sorted. Then, it creates the sorted array by merging successively the smaller sub-sets in an orderly fashion.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-ruby">
# merge two arrays in orderly fashion (from smaller to greater number)
def merge(left, right)
  index_left = 0
  index_right = 0
  result = []

  # iterate through both arrays to add sorted numbers to new array
  while index_left < left.length && index_right < right.length
    if left[index_left] <= right[index_right]
      result << left[index_left]
      index_left += 1
    else
      result << right[index_right]
      index_right += 1
    end
  end

  # add remaining sorted numbers from one array to new array
  if (index_left < left.length) then
    for index in (index_left..left.length-1)
      result << left[index]
    end
  else
    for index in (index_right..right.length-1)
      result << right[index]
    end
  end

  return result
end

def merge_sort(array)

  if array.length > 1

    # break down recursively the array into smaller sub-sets
    half = array.length / 2
    left = array[0..half-1]
    right = array[half..array.length-1]
    sorted_left = merge_sort(left)
    sorted_right = merge_sort(right)

    # merge smaller sorted sub-sets in orderly fashion (from smaller to greater number)
    sorted_array = merge(sorted_left, sorted_right)

    return sorted_array
  else
    return array
  end
end
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The speed of the merge sort comes from the fact that it is easy to merge a sorted list with another already sorted list. It performs decently well on larger sets. Please find below the same performance tests run with merge sort.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-ruby">
time_start = Time.now
merge_sort([2, 8, 9, 0, 6, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1])
time_merge = Time.now
puts "*** Merge sort of small array in #{time_merge - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Merge sort of small array in 1.9e-05 seconds ***

time_start = Time.now
merge_sort(array_with_1000_numbers)
time_merge = Time.now
puts "*** Merge sort of large array in #{time_merge - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Merge sort of large array in 0.002174 seconds ***

        QUICK SORT selects an element in the array called the pivot, moves all the values less than the pivot to before the pivot, and all the values greater than the pivot to after the pivot. After each pass, the pivot value is in the correct place in the set, even if the values before and after the pivot are not in the correct order. Then, this process is recursively repeated for the smaller sub-sets (lesser and greater than the pivot value) until the entire array is sorted.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-ruby">
def quick_sort(array)

  if array.length > 1

    # select pivot
    pivot_index = array.length / 2
    pivot_value = array[pivot_index]

    lesser = []
    equal = []
    greater = []

    # push all values less than pivot to lesser, and all values greater than pivot to greater
    array.each do |number|
      if number < pivot_value
        lesser << number
      elsif number == pivot_value
        equal << number
      else
        greater << number
      end
    end

    # repeat recursively for smaller sub-sets (lesser and greater)
    sorted_array = quick_sort(lesser) + equal + quick_sort(greater)

    return sorted_array
  else
    return array
  end
end
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Quick sort is a pretty fast and efficient algorithm. Please find below the same performance tests run with quick sort.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-ruby">
time_start = Time.now
quick_sort([2, 8, 9, 0, 6, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1])
time_quick = Time.now
puts "*** Quick sort of small array in #{time_quick - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Quick sort of small array in 1.3e-05 seconds ***

time_start = Time.now
quick_sort(array_with_1000_numbers)
time_quick = Time.now
puts "*** Quick sort of large array in #{time_quick - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Quick sort of large array in 0.000401 seconds ***
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Even if quick sort seems to be the better algorithm out of the three, it is important to note that choosing a good pivot element is key, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower performance, but good choice of pivots (median value for instance) yields optimal performance. In Ruby, array#sort does leverage the quick sort algorithm, and performs far better because of its pivot selection. Please find below the same performance tests run with array#sort.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-ruby">
time_start = Time.now
[2, 8, 9, 0, 6, 5, 7, 4, 3, 1].sort
time_ruby = Time.now
puts "*** Ruby sort of small array in #{time_ruby - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Ruby sort of small array in 3.0e-06 seconds ***

time_start = Time.now
array_with_1000_numbers.sort
time_ruby = Time.now
puts "*** Ruby sort of large array in #{time_ruby - time_start} seconds ***"

# => *** Ruby sort of large array in 5.8e-05 seconds ***

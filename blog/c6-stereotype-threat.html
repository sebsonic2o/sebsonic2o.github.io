      <p>
        Dr Claude M. Steele, a social psychologist, is best known for his work on stereotype threat. He defines it as "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group". It is about being afraid that a negative stereotype applies to you because you are identifying (or being identified) with some group. And this fear is causing you to underperform and fall right into the stereotype. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy...

        I cannot think of a time when I felt victim of stereotype threat. My fears and anxieties are more personal. However, I can see how they can expand when someone attempts to project negativity onto me. I can be affected, and an internal struggle would occur to restore my balance so that I move forward with confidence again.

        Stereotypes are bad enough. So let's not make it worse by letting them own us and others. It starts with promoting an all-inclusive environment, in which any pattern of isolation is being identified and remedied. For this, it is important to make sure that everyone engages with everyone. And some sort of feedback framework can help as long as it is kind. Include! Do not project!

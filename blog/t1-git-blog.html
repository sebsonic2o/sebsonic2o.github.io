        Letâ€™s imagine that we want to write a document and track our changes. For this, we need to be able to take snapshots of our changes, save them, and see them. Version Control allows us to do just that. Now, let's consider that developers generally collaborate on projects that include many files with a lot of changes. Without Version Control, only the latest change would be kept. A change could introduce a problem or, even worse, erase good work. With no way to look back at changes, this would get very messy.

        So tracking changes help developers know exactly where they're at on a project. And developers can review past occurrences on a project and act accordingly. Git is a software that can empower you to do this locally on your computer. For this, Git simply differentiates three states (modified, staged, and committed) for a change and let you move freely from one state to the other. When a change is committed, it is officially saved and you can go back to it whenever you want, or need to.

        In many cases, your work is to be shared with others. GitHub basically provides an online location for your Git work to be shared with others. You can sign up for an account today. It's free!

    <section id="article-teaser">Or thinking about age discrimination in the technology industry...</section>
    <article>
      <p>
        When researching ageism in technology, two quotes are widely being cited to drive the argument home:<br>
        "Young people are just smarter", Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, told an audience.<br>
        “People over 45 basically die in terms of new ideas”, Vinod Khosla, a prominent venture capitalist, once said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, there is a youth worship in technology. Young tech workers fill offices across Silicon Valley. At Facebook and Google, the median is 29. At Twitter, the median is 28. Is ageism going on then?
      </p>
      <p>
        Any company needs an influx of young talents. And it is particularly true for the technology industry where it is a question of survival to stay ahead of the curve. The young has been brought up on the latest technologies. And the young is cheap. So it should be expected that some job openings target recent graduates with few years experience or none. This is not ageism!
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the age imbalance in the technology industry can vary widely from company to company. Consumer web companies are full of young employees fresh out of college. Computer hardware and business software firms are packed with people in their 30's and 40's. At Oracle, the median age is 38. At HP, the median is 40.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, like Vinod, many in the tech world would prone that innovation only stems from youth. Middle-aged tech workers or entrepreneurs can be dismissed because of this stereotype. This is ageism! Innovation advantage is also knowledge, maturity, experience, and connections.
      </p>
        Mark Zuckerberg was 22 when he said that "young people are just smarter". Like Mark, the young tends to discriminate against the old. This is not news. However, there is some apparent compounded effect of youth celebration and concentration. And, under the disguise of culture, ageism is rampant in some companies.
      <p>
        Yes, age discrimination does occur. Some people views are not going to change. Vinod was saying "People over 45 basically die in terms of new ideas because they keep falling back on old habits". I decided to take matters in my own hands and make sure that I can keep up with the pace of change. Keep a young mind and benefit from knowledge, maturity, experience, and connections!

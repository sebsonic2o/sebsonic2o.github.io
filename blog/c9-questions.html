      <p>
        We all need feedback to better ourselves. More often than not, good feedback comes when asking good questions. To be honest, it is not easy to ask questions, let alone good ones. For me, it starts with feeling good about my question, going through a quick mental checklist before asking. In other words:

      </p>
      <p>
        HAVE I READ ENOUGH? It is a much needed first step. This is about putting some effort trying to look for a solution on my own. If I am not willing to do my homework, should I expect someone else to do it for me? And there are now a lot of online resources out there. Often, I find a suitable answer. Sometimes, I don't. On some rare occasions, it adds to more confusion. In any case, it leads to a better question because I elevated my thought process through that effort, and I have something to show for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        AM I READY FOR AN ANSWER? This is counter-intuitive, but an important mental check nonetheless. Asking a question is like opening a door. If there is not enough of a desire to really listen, I should prevent myself from asking in the first place. When someone answers, I should be patient, not interrupt, follow up, and apply any other relevant considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        AM I BEING CLEAR AND CONCISE? It starts with being able to introduce my question by summarizing it, and defining a context. Then, it should lead to specifics while keeping it short. It takes practice. This implies that it won't be perfect everytime. But it does improve overtime as long as I keep at it, and leverage feedback for more clarity and concision in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        IS IT THE RIGHT PLACE (AND TIME)? Last but not least, I should consider where and when my question is to be asked. It takes some knowledge of an environment and/or others. Sure, I should make sure that the context of my question fits in. But, it is also about observing the dynamics so that I have a sense of what works and doesn't work for others in that environment. It is such a shame to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, isn't it?
      </p>

        No matter what, answers will vary. But checking your intentions when asking questions surely helps...

        smile with the sad,<br>
        love what you've got, and remember what you had.<br>
        Always forgive, but never forget.<br>
        Learn from your mistakes, but never regret.<br>
        People change. Things go wrong.<br>
        Just remember life goes on."
